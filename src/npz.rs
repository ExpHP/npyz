//! Utilities for working with `npz` files.
//!
//! NPZ files are a format used by numpy to store archives of multiple arrays.
//! The format itself is just a `.zip` file containing files with a `.npy` extension.
//!
//! When the `"npz"` feature is enabled, this module provides adapters around the
//! [`zip`][::zip] crate that read and write NPZ files.
//!
//! Even without the `"npz"` feature, this module always provides a set of utility functions
//! for converting between array names and filenames inside the zip file.
//! This allows you to use your own zip library. The [`examples` directory] includes an example
//! of how to read and write an npz without the feature.
//!
